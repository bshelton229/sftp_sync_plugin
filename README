= SFTP Sync Plugin

This plugin provides a very simple mechanism for synchronizing a local
folder with an SFTP location. It uses a very simple algorithm that
compares modification dates.

== Dependencies

This plugin requires the Net::SFTP and the Net::SSH module. You can
download a copy from the project's respective websites.

    http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/sftp/v2/api/

    http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/ssh/v2/api

This plugin was tested with version Net::SFTP 2.0.4 and Net::SSH 2.0.17.

We also require ftools for managing files on the local side, YAML for
storing the modification times of the files between runs, and Log4r
for logging messages to the console.

== Example

First, create a new instance that can connect to the remote server.

    sync = SftpSync("somehost.somewhere.com",
                    "username",
                    "password")

Next, pull the files from the remote location to your local machine.

    sync.pull("remote_dir", "/home/local_dir", true)

The last parameter is a boolean value that indicates to SftpSync that
you want to delete files on the local side that are not present on the
remote side.

Later on you can push the files back up to the remote location. Any
files that you edited will be uploaded.

    sync.push("remote_dir", "/home/local_dir", true)

The last parameter is a boolean value that indicates to SftpSync that
you want to delete files on the remote side that are not present on
the local side.
